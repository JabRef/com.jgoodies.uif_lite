# com.jgoodies.uif_lite

JGoodies Looks examples used to provide some classes used by JabRef.

According to [FormDev](http://www.formdev.com/jformdesigner/doc/jgoodies/#uif_lite), the source is part of the [JGoodies Looks](https://java.net/projects/looks/).
These are not available as separate project, but only as tag at https://java.net/projects/looks/sources/svn/show/tags/R_2_1_4/src/demo/com/jgoodies/uif_lite.

With this repository we make them available as a separate library to enable inclusion in JabRef.
